echo One thing left to try See if you can make it
echo Before you choose the night
echo And the silence overtakes you
echo If you looked into the fire And you had that conversation Then, theres one thing left to try
echo If you want to save your life
echo Fear is his name, but his friends still call him God
echo Again and again, the thought remains
echo I dont wanna die
echo Wishingd done something
echo More than whats required
echo To last until the sunset
echo No, I dont wanna die
echo Thinking that Im dreaming
echo Theres one thing left to try
echo If you want to change your life
echo Today I left those thoughts behind, behind
echo Over and over, you die just to feel alive
echo The only way to get rid of the feeling
echo You have to draw the line
echo And remember, theres more than youre seeing
echo Decide
echo Do you wanna keep us alive?
echo Do you wanna feel alive?
echo Do you wanna keep us alive?
echo Do you wanna feel alive? Fun is over tonight
echo Do you wanna keep us alive? Fun is over tonight
echo Do you wanna feel alive? Fun is over tonight
echo Do you wanna keep us alive? Fun is over tonight
echo Do you wanna feel alive?
